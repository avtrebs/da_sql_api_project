# da_sql_api_project
API-SQL team project from Alexandra Persina, Michael Hoch, Hans Reimer and me.
In this project we combined our SQL, Python and API skills and used them in combination with each other.

## Task Overview:
Our task is to find a situation where the weather has impacted on flight cancellations and use this to contribute some knowledge about how different weather affects flights in different cities.

## Data:
1. Flights data (csv file from transtats, we get it already from neufische) from August and September 2017.
2. Weather data (API from meteostat) from August and September 2017.

## Hypotheses:
1. Can we see hurricane Harvey in the weather and flights data? 
2. Can we see that flights to Houston got cancelled?
3. Can we see cancelled flights on days before and after the hurricane?
